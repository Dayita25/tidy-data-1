# tidy-data
clean data course project
Output Steps - Here we begin how to create the data set of training and test
Reading training tables - xtrain / ytrain, subject train
#Reading the testing tables
Read the features data
Read activity labels data
Create Sanity and Column Values to the Train Data
Create Sanity and column values to the test data
Create sanity check for the activity labels value
Merging the train and test data - important outcome of the project
Create the main data table merging both table tables - this is the outcome of 1
Need step is to read all the values that are available
Need to get a subset of all the mean and standards and the correspondongin activityID and subjectID 
A subtset has to be created to get the required dataset
Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
New tidy set has to be created 
The last step is to write the ouput to a text file
